# Pyber_Analysis

# Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze the ride-sharing data of PyBer based on city type - Urban, Suburban and Rural, and help to improve the services by the company to provie a satisfactory experience to the users. 

# Results
In this analysis, multiple evaluations were performed and the data provided by the ride-sharing company was used to observe and determine the total number of rides in each city type based on different factors such as the number of drivers, the ride fare and the number of rides.
Based on the calculations performed, the Urban city type has the highest number of drivers and rides and the highest total in terms of fares. On the other hand, the Rural city type has the highest average fare per driver and per ride.

# Summary

Overall, we observe quite a remarquable disparity in the number of drivers in the Rural areas compared to Suburban and Urban areas. My recommendations to the company would be to increase the number of drivers in the rural areas to meet the demand. I would also recommend to decrease the ride fare in the rural areas as well to encourage the riders to use the ride-sharing application more often.
